# SDDM

## THIS CONFIG IS NOW OUTDATED AS I AM USING LY (here)[https://github.com/fairyglade/ly]

Theme in use : **Sugar-Candy Dark**

Credits : **Marian Arlt and team** 

Link : [Sugar-Candy](https://github.com/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-dark)

KDE : `systemsettings > Colors & Themes > Login Screen (SDDM) > Get New > sugar-candy` (to get theme through kde)

## NOTES

1. In order to re-create this sddm theme, simply editing `theme.conf` **WILL NOT BE ENOUGH** as it does not have properties of adding Components and `font-family`.

2. While editing any asset or component, it is advised to run `sddm-greeter path/to/sddm/theme` rather than rebooting to avoid running into any errors.

Note: Image taken by running `sddm-greeter` command. Other components like powermenu will only render in the actual SDDM initialisation.
