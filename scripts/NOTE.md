# NOTE

## The following scripts are outdated and are not managed by me as it has either been taken over by ags or just redundant:

### The scripts below are NOT maintained or modified by me in a very long time: 

1. `locker.sh`
2. `notifinit.sh`
3. `ss_fullscreen.sh`
4. `wals.sh`
5. `fullscreen.sh`

In case you use anything outdated that might help you, I have it in the `/scripts/outdated` directory.

It has **HIGHLY ADVISED** to atleast look at the scripts and modify them as you need before **executing** them. You might need some AUR packages to run them in the first place so be adivsed.

## For `gemini_ai.sh` it is mentioned in the comments as well, you need YOUR OWN API KEY for the script to work

Here is a demo of a few scripts and their rofi:
