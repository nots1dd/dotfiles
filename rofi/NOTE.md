# NOTE

For the following scripts I am NOT using custom rofi (it's from @adi1090x's rofi on github [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi))

1. `wals-change.sh`
2. `ags.sh`
3. `spotdl.sh`

You can either re-create these rofi files yourself by going on the github link shared, or just go ahead check out the `rofi/launchers/` directory, which has the 3 rofi files that I use, along with the colors and fonts rasi files.
