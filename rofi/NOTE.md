# NOTE
## Some configs are directly from @adi1090x's rofi on github [link](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) / picked up from r/unixporn

For all configs I am either using modified .rasi files from [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) or unixporn, but for the most part they are modified for my needs.

You can either re-create these rofi files yourself by going on the github link shared, or just go ahead check out the `rofi/launchers/` directory (which are directly from [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)), which has the 3 rofi files that I have used, along with the colors and fonts rasi files.

These are not the most managed files, however it should have every file you need in-case you every want to directly copy my dotfiles. If any issues, you can open an issue or even better open a PR
