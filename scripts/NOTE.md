# NOTE

## The following scripts are outdated and are not managed by me as it has either been taken over by ags or just redundant:

1. `locker.sh`
2. `notifinit.sh`
3. `ss_fullscreen.sh`
4. `wals.sh`
5. `fullscreen.sh`

Other than no 3. (which works really well with non-ags bars), no scripts are maintained and thus **BE CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU EXECUTE**
