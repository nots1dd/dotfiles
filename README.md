(Wallpaper for hyprlock and rofi change automatically with the `wals-change.sh` and others using sed not pywal)

I cannot make rofi themes but I took a lot of inspiration from [this repo](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) and a lot of other repos I found from unix porn and stuff

AGS default config is from [Aylur's dotfiles](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles) but with some modifications

### Note:
Using waybar to get information of disk, memory, cpu so on. AGS is the default bar in this config

Plans:
1. Pywal the waybar and other color schema (priority/low)
2. Proper config of ags
3. Clipboard and wals-change.sh rofi config
